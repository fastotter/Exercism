# Exercism

Just a place to store Exercism programs as I learn Clojure.

#### anagram
- Uses ```keep``` to filter a sequence to another sequence of items we want to
keep/isolate

#### isbn-verifier
- Uses ```map``` to convert a collection of ISBN digit characters to a collection of integers
and uses ```map``` to multiple each number in collection to by a number in another
collection, e.g.,
```
(\1 \4 \8 \X) => (1 4 8 10)
(map * '(1 2 3) '(2 3 4)) => (2 6 12)
```
- Uses ```reduce``` to sum numbers in a collection.
- Uses ```str/join, str/split and re-pattern``` to remove all '-' characters from a string.


#### run-length-encoding
- Uses ```loop recur``` to transform strings, e.g.,
```
(encode "aaabcdde") => "3abc2de"
(decode "5xy3z") => "xxxxxyzzz"
```

#### word-count
- Uses ```re-seq``` to create sequence of words from one string.
- Uses ```lower-case``` to change mixed case string to all-lower-case string.
- Uses a map to count number of objects (in this case strings)
- Uses ```loop recur``` to create the map (^)
