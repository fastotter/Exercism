(ns minesweeper
  "Given a 2-D minesweeper board with mines (or no mines) update the board with
  numbers in cells that represent the number of adjacent cells that have mines.

  The implementation uses a vector (a 1-D array) to represent the 2-D board/array.
  The indexes used to access cells are zero based.

  So a 3x3 minesweeper board would have these indexes.

  [4][5][6]
